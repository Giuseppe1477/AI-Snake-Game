## Proposal Proposal: Teaching an AI to Play Video Games

## What is the problem that you will be investigating? Why is it interesting?
The problem we are trying to solve is how to implement artificial intelligence to play, learn, and perfect playing a video game. This problem might not seem important, but if we can make an AI capable of learning a game we will have deepened our knowledge of AI and how to implement learning algorithms. On the more practical side, a problem in the game development industry is the limitless amount of time needed to test video games. Testing for bugs and gameplay mechanics is often costly and time-consuming, and this can be solved using AI to automate the process.

## What reading will you examine to provide context and background?
We will read up on the various methods and techniques that can be used to construct this AI. Additionally, we will investigate similar AI that already exist and what methods their creators used to allow the AI to learn how to play games.

## What data will you use? If you are collecting new data, how will you do it?
Data will be collected from the performance of the AI. The data will be a combination of how close the AI came to beating the game, and how much time the AI spent in the attempt. Data will also be collected from already existent leaderboards of human performance with which can be compared against the AI’s performance.

## What method or algorithm are you proposing? If there are existing implementations, will you use them and how? How do you plan to improve or modify such implementations? You don’t have to have an exact answer at this point, but you should have a general sense of how you will approach the problem you are working on.
We will use AI methods such as deep learning, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory, reinforcement learning, and neuroevolution. We will also be using already existing implementations of similar AI as a reference to build a more optimal algorithm. Our algorithm will differ from other implementations in that it will be designed specifically for our game, and thus more optimized for it.

## How will you evaluate your results? Qualitatively, what kind of results do you expect (e.g. plots or figures)? Quantitatively, what kind of analysis will you use to evaluate and/or compare your results (e.g. what performance metrics or statistical tests)?
We will evaluate our results by using the following procedures. We will evaluate the effectiveness of our AI by comparing the scores it achieves with the leaderboards of human performance on the video game. If the AI can consistently match or outperform the top leaderboards of human achieved scores, then the AI can be considered a success. Qualitatively, we expect not only for the AI to get closer to beating the game, but we also expect it to increase its speed and efficiency when beating the game.

## What game will you focus the AI on?
We will focus our AI on Snake, Flappy Bird, or Brick Breaker. We will research more into which one is ideal and are open to suggestions.
